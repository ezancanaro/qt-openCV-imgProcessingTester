# Qt-openCV-imgProcessingTester

This repository contains a QT 4 GUI client used for testing different openCV transformations.
I made this client mostly to explore the different image processing techiques provided by the library, using a set of sliders and inputs to dinamycally change transformation parameters. 

Made with openCV 4.0, never kept up to date.
